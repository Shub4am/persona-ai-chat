# 📝 🧠 Persona AI Chat 

A Next.js project that creates AI-powered personas trained on specific YouTube tech content.
You can chat with these personas as if they were real people — but with a disclaimer:
- ⚠️ This is an AI-generated style of the persona for educational/demo purposes. It is not actually them.

Built with **Next.js**, **JavaScript**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **shadcn/ui**.
